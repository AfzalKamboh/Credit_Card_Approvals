# Credit_Card_Approvals
Build an ML-based credit card approval predictor for commercial banks to automate application analysis, saving time and reducing errors. High loan balances, low income, or excessive credit inquiries often lead to rejections. This project replicates real banks' automation for efficient, accurate, and faster decision-making.
